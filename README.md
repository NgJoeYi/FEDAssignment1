This is my FED1 assignment project

Idea:
1: User Audience and Intent Purpose:

This front-end development project focuses on creating the Mrs Bean Cafe website, tailored for coffee enthusiasts and families in search of unique culinary experiences. The primary goal of this immersive online space is not only to inform users but also to captivate their interest. Through enriching workshops, the website provides insights into the world of coffee, inviting both coffee enthusiasts and families of all ages, seeking good food or enriching activities. The neutral color palette chosen for the website aims to establish a warm and inviting gateway, introducing users to the cafe's ambiance. Users visiting the website will have the opportunity to make informed decisions about whether to explore our menu or join us in our engaging workshops.

2: Who the Website is For and Value Provided to Users:
Mrs Bean Cafe was created with the goal of attracting diverse group of users. The first group consists of *coffee enthusiasts* who are keen to explore what they might learn through our workshops led by expert baristas. The second group includes *families seeking culinary experiences*. For them, we offer a family-friendly menu and enriching activities suitable for all ages. 
The website is not just about delicious food; it also aims to build a community among people who share similar interests. Additionally, we provide exclusive flash deals on both workshops and food items to make the experience at Mrs Bean Cafe more appealing for our users. Overall, the goal of this website is to offer something special for every visitors to Mrs Bean Cafe.

3: What the Website is Catering For:
Side note: All of these web page consists of responsive design and browser compatibility to cater for users on mobile phone or laptops. 

responsive designs:
Homepage - Adjusted dimensions of elements such as the slideshow, concierge information, video and small food images. 
Menu page - Adjusted food item elements from 4 in a row, to 2 in a row.
Workshop page - All images are adjusted to maintain the proper ratio, and the image for the complimentary door gift image is positioned above its corresponding information.
Deals page - Adjusted deal item elements from 4 in a row to 1 per row.

HOMEPAGE (index.html) - As the front end developer of Mrs Bean's Cafe, my primary focus is on crafting a captivating first impression for users. The homepage seamlessly integrates an array of tempting food items and showcases the variety of workshops we offer. Additionally, placement of buttons facilitates user navigation, guiding them to explore other pages, contact details, and our social media presence.
The objective is to engage users instantly, fostering their interest and prompting them to delve deeper into the website. A swift glance at the homepage should ideally inspire users to plan a visit or continue their exploration of our content.

MENU PAGE (Menu_MrsBeanCafe.html) - The purpose of this website is to provide users with a visual experience of our food items, aiding them in making informed decisions about what to add to their cart. The inclusion of food images is crucial to me as I believe it enhances the decision-making process. The page is organized into three categories: breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Each food item is accompanied by price and descriptions for those who may need additional information. My goal for this webpage is to implement a cart that slides out from the right when users click "Add to cart." This feature will enable them to review their selected items and the total price before finalizing their order.

WORKSHOP PAGE (Workshop_MrsBeanCafe.html) - Through our workshops, we aim to highlight how coffee can bring people together and create lasting experiences, be it coffee enthusiasts or families looking for enriching activities. This page focuses on the different workshops we offer, currently featuring three options with the potential for more in the future, including parent-kid workshops. As a thank-you gesture, users exploring this page can find a section offering complimentary door gifts for those joining our workshops. The page also breaks down the equipment used in the workshops, with buttons encouraging users to participate in these engaging experiences.

DEALS PAGE (Deals_MrsBeanCafe.html) - On the Deals and Promotions webpage, we feature exciting offers and special promotions for our customers. Explore a variety of deals ranging from discounted menu items to exclusive workshop packages. Our goal is to provide value and unique opportunities to our visitors, encouraging them to make the most of their experience with Mrs Bean Cafe. Check back regularly for updated deals and promotions that add an extra layer of delight to your visit.
